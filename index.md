## ‚úçÔ∏è Exam Content
### 1.0. Magento Architecture & Customisation Techniques
This section covers **33%** of the exam.

#### 1.1. Describe the Magento Module-Based Architecture
> What are the significant steps to add a new module?

You need to create the following files:
- `registration.php`
- `module.xml`

##### `registration.php`
This file is included by the Composer autoloader and is added to the static list of components in `Magento\Framework\Component\ComponentRegistrar`. Example:

```PHP
<?php
use \Magento\Framework\Component\ComponentRegistrar;

ComponentRegistrar::register(
    ComponentRegistrar::MODULE,        // type
    'YourCompany_YourModule',          // componentName
    __DIR__                            // path
);
```

Once Magento has found this file, it will then look to find `etc/module.xml`.

##### `module.xml`
A component declares itself (that is, defines its name and existence) in the `module.xml` file located in the module's `etc/` directory. This file specifies the loading sequence for the module and it's setup version (if not using Declarative Schema).

The sequence tells Magento which order to load modules in. This is done in `Magento\Framework\Module\ModuleList\Loader.php` and only occurs when the module is installed. This sequence is useful for events, plugins, preferences, and layouts.
- **NB:** If your module modifies the layout of another and your module is loaded first, the other module will overwrite your modifications.

Example:
```XML
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Module/etc/module.xsd">
    <module name="YourCompany_YourModule" setup_version="1.0.0">
        <sequence>
            <module name="TheirCompany_TheirModule" />
            <module name="AnotherCompany_AnotherModule" />
        </sequence>
    </module>
</config>
```

> What are the different Composer package types?

| Name | Package Type | Description |
| :--: | :----------: | :---------- |
| Metapackage | metapackage | Technically, a Composer package type, not a Magento component type. A metapackage consists of only a `composer.json` file that specifies a list of components and their dependencies. For example, both Magento Open Source and Magento Commerce are metapackages. |
| Module | magento2-module | Code that modifies Magento application behavior. You can upload a single module to the Magento Marketplace or your module can be dependent on some parent package. |
| Theme | magento2-theme | Code that modifies the look and feel of the storefront or Magento Admin. |
| Language Package | magento2-language | Translations for the storefront or Admin. |

---
#### 1.2. Describe the Magento Directory Structure
> How do you locate different files in Magento?

All of the core Magento files are located in the `vendor/magento/` directory with some supporting JavaScript and CSS files being stored in `lib/`.

Third-party files can be found in their respective `vendor/vendor-name/module-name/` directories.

For your customisations:
- For modules, use `app/code`.
- For storefront themes, use `app/design/frontend`.
- For Admin themes, use `app/design/adminhtml`.
- For language packages, `use app/i18n`.

##### `/Api`: Service Contracts
The `/Api` directory stores the contracts or interfaces that are exposed to the API. An example of this would be `Magento\Catalog\Api\CategoryListInterface`.

##### `/Api/Data`: Data Service Contracts
This folder contains interfaces that represent data. Examples of this would be a
product interface, a category interface, or a customer interface. The concrete
implementations of these interfaces usually do little more than provide getters and
setters for data.

See `Magento\Catalog\Api\Data\ProductInterface` for an example.

##### `/Block`: View Models
Blocks can be considered as template assistants. Very little functionality or business logic should be done in templates - that is the responsibility of the Block.

##### `/Console`: Console Commands
When running `bin/magento` on the command line, a list of available commands
to run is output. The code for commands should be placed inside the `/Console` directory.

##### `/Controller`: Web Request Handlers
This directory stores controller classes for web requests.

##### `/Cron`: Cron Job Classes
Definitions for cron jobs are stored here.

##### `/etc`: Configuration Files
Any files directly within this directory are applied *globally*. You can restrict the *area* these files belong to by placing it in the relevant sub-directory - `etc/frontend/`, `etc/adminhtml/` etc.
- **NB:** Some files **MUST** be placed within a particular area whilst others **MUST** be global.

##### `/Helper`: Aggregated Functionality
Small, reusable snippets of code should be stored in a helper class.

##### `/i18n`: Localisation Files
This directory contains the translation CSV files for the module. These CSV files contain two columns, `from` and `to`.

##### `/Model`: Data Handling & Data Structures
A self-explanatory directory.

##### `/Model/ResourceModel`: Database Interactions
The classes stored in this directory dictate how data is stored and retrieved from the database. Any *direct* database interaction should be done within these files.

See `vendor/magento/module-catalog/Model/ResourceModel/Product.php` for an example.

##### `/Observer`: Event Listeners
When Magento fires an event, certain observers are called - decoupling the system. Magento Commerce integrates with RabbitMQ which allows even more control and reliability to this process. Event data should be able to be stored and then run in a queue at a later time.

Observers **MUST** implement the `Magento\Framework\Event\ObserverInterface`. The PHP class should follow the stand of using TitleCase while the event name should be snake_case.

Observers should not contain any business logic. This logic should instead be placed in another class and injected into your observer.

##### `/Plugin`
This directory stores your module's plugins. These are covered in more detail in a later section.

##### `/Setup`: Database Modification
Stores the following files:
- `InstallSchema.php`
    - Sets up table and column schema when the module is installed.
- `UpgradeSchema.php`
    - Modifies table and column schema when the module version is upgraded.
- `Recurring.php`
    - Runs after every install or upgrade.
- `InstallData.php`
    - Sets up data when the module is installed. An example would be adding a custom CMS block.
- `UpgradeData.php`
    - Modifies data after the module is installed and when the module version is upgraded.
- `RecurringData.php`
    - Applies to data after every install or upgrade.

##### `/Test`: Module Tests
This directory stores your module's tests. Tests can be run via the command line using `bin/magento dev:tests:run`.

##### `/Ui`: Data Generation Files

##### `/view/[area]/templates`: Block Templates
The counterpart to a Block is a template to render the HTML for the block. Whilst the block (in `/Block`) represents the business logic, the template represents how the results of the business logic are shown to the user.

##### `/view/[area]/web`: Web Assets
Web assets such as images, CSS, JavaScript, LESS, and SCSS are stored in this directory.

##### `view/[area]/web/template`: JavaScript Templates
HTML templates that can be requested asynchronously via JavaScript are stored in this directory. These files often contain KnockoutJS declarative bindings.

##### `/view/adminhtml/ui_component`: Adminhtml UI Components
This directory contains the XML configuration for UI components. They are used to represent distinct UI elements, such as grids and forms, and are designed to provide flexible user interface rendering. Most Magento Admin grids (such as the Catalog Product grid and the Customer grid) are composed with UI components. The
checkout on the frontend is also a UI component.

#### 1.3. Utilise Configuration and Configuration Variables Scope
> Which configuration files are important in the development cycle?

##### `acl.xml`
Defines permissions for accessing protected resources.

##### `config.xml`
Loads configuration values into `Stores > Configuration` in the Magento Admin. This file can also encrypt configuration entries.

##### `crontab.xml`
Defines cron job scheduling.

##### `di.xml`
This file configures dependency injection for your module. It defines plugins, preferences, concrete classes for interfaces, virtual types, and constructor argument modifications.

##### `email_templates.xml`

##### `events.xml`
This file registers observers.

##### `indexer.xml`
This file configures Magento indexers.

##### `module.xml`
This file is **required** by Magento.

##### `mview.xml`
Triggers a type of event when data is modified in a database column - most often used for indexing.

##### `view.xml`
This file is similar to `config.xml` but is used to specify the default values for design configuration.

##### `webapi.xml`
Configures API access and routes.

##### `widget.xml`
Configures widgets to be used in products, CMS blocks, and CMS pages.

##### `[area]/routes.xml`
This file tells Magento that this area accepts web requests. The route node configures the first part of the layout handle (route ID) and the front name (first segment in the URL after the domain name).

##### `adminhtml/menu.xml`
Configuration for the menu in Magento Admin.

##### `adminhtml/system.xml`
Configures tabs, sections, groups, and fields found in `Store > Configuration` in Magento Admin.

> How do you identify the configuration scope for a given variable?

---
> How do native Magento scopes (for example, price or inventory) affect development and decision-making processes?

> How can you fetch a system configuration value programmatically?

---
> How can you override system configuration values for a given store using XML configuration?

---
#### 1.4. Demonstrate How To Use Dependency Injection
> How are objects realized in code?
 
Since dependency injection happens automatically through the constructor, Magento
must handle class creation - either at the time of injection or via a factory.

##### Class Creation During Injection
First the object manager locates the proper class type. If an interface is requested, hopefully an entry in `di.xml` will provide a concrete class for the interface (if not, an exception will be thrown).

Then the parameters for the constructor are loaded and recursively parsed meaning that the dependencies for the initially requested class are loaded as well as the dependencies of those dependencies as well.

The deploy mode (`bin/magento deploy:mode:show)` determines which class loader is used:
- `vendor/magento/framework/ObjectManager/Factory/Dynamic/Developer.php`
- `vendor/magento/framework/ObjectManager/Factory/Dynamic/Production.php`

##### Class Creation Via Factories

---
> Why is it important to have a centralized object creation process?

Having a centralised process to create objects makes testing much easier. It also
provides a simple interface to substitute objects as well as modify existing ones.

---
> How can you override a native class, inject your class into another object, and use other techniques available in `di.xml` (for example, `virtualTypes`)?

##### Overriding Native Classes
Preferences are used to substitute entire classes. They can also be used to specify concrete classes for interfaces:
```XML
<preference for="Magento\GoogleTagManager\Block\ListJson"
            type="YourCompany\YourModule\Path\To\Your\Class"
/>
```

##### Injecting Your Class into Other Objects
Specify a `<type>` entry with your class as an `<argument>`:
```XML
<type name="Path\To\Your\Class\To\Inject\Into">
    <arguments>
        <argument xsi:type="object">
            Path\To\Your\Injected\Class
        </argument>
    </arguments>
</type>
```

##### Virtual Types
A virtual type allows you to create an instance of an existing class that has custom constructor arguments. This is useful in cases where you need a ‚Äúnew‚Äù class only because the constructor arguments need to be changed. This is used frequently in Magento to reduce redundant PHP classes.

---
> How would you obtain a class instance from different places in the code?

---
#### 1.5. Demonstrate Ability To Use Plugins
> How are plugins used in core code? How can they be used for customizations?

A plugin is a class that modifies the behavior of public class functions by intercepting a function call and running code before, after, or around that call. This allows you to customise or extend the behavior of original, public methods for any class or interface.

##### Before Plugin
Before plugins are used when you want to modify the function input. To modify the input of a function:
```PHP
public function beforeFunctionName(
    Class\Containing\The\Function $subject,
    $normalFunctionInput1,
    $normalFunctionInput2,
) {
    // ...
    
    return [$normalFunctionInput1, $normalFunctionInput2];
}
```

The `return` value determines the array of arguments being passed into the next plugin or targeted function.

##### After Plugin
After plugins are used when you want to modify the function output. To modify the output of a function:
```PHP
public function afterFunctionName(
    Class\Containing\The\Function $subject,
    $result
) {
    // ...
    
    return $result;
}
```

The `return` value determines the output of the function being passed into the next plugin or targeted function.

##### Around Plugin
Around plugins give you full control over the function, it's inputs, and it's output. To use an around plugin to replace a function:
```PHP
public function aroundFunctionName(
    Class\Containing\The\Function $subject,
    callable $proceed
) {
    // ...
    
    $result = $proceed();
    
    // ...
    
    return $result;
    
}
```

##### Declaring Plugins
To declare a plugin, add a `<type/>` to your module's `di.xml`:
```XML
<type name="Class\Containing\The\Function\To\Plug\Into">
    <plugin name="PluginName"
            type="Class\Containing\Your\Plugin"
            disabled="false"
            sortOrder="10"
    />
</type>
```

##### Plugin Limitations
Plugins have the following limitations:
- Only work with **public** functions
- **Do not** work with `final` classes or functions
- **Do not** work with `static` functions

---
#### 1.6. Configure Event Observers & Scheduled Jobs
Observers listen for events that are triggered in Magento. Scheduled jobs perform an action at a specified interval.

Observers **MUST** implement the `Magento\Framework\Event\ObserverInterface`.

---
> How are observers registered?

Create an `<event/>` node in your `etc/[area]/events.xml` file:
```XML
<event name="event_for_your_observer_to_listen_for">
    <observer name="observerName"
              instance="Your\Observer\Class"
    />
</event>
```

---
> How are they scoped for frontend or backend?

Place the `events.xml` file in the `etc/frontend/` and `etc/adminhtml/` directories respectively.

---
> How are automatic events created, and how should they be used?

Events should be used when you do not want to change the data. They can be triggered by injecting an instance of `Magento\Framework\Event\ManagerInterface` into the constructor and calling: `$this->eventManager->dispatch('event_name', [params]);`.

---
> How are scheduled jobs configured?

To configure a scheduled job you need to assign it a name, specify the function it should execute, the class that function belongs to, and set the schedule using the regular cron schedule notatation. Scheduled jobs are specified in the `etc/crontab.xml` file:
```XML
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"    
        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Magento_Cron:etc/crontab.xsd">
    <group id="default">
        <job name="cron_job_name"
             instance="Path\To\Your\Class"
             method="execute">
            <schedule>*/5 * * * *</schedule>
        </job>
    </group>
</config>
```

---
#### 1.7. Utilise the CLI

> How are commands used in the development cycle?

Commands provide a secure method of perfoming tasks that may otherwise be insecure or more time consuming to perform through the Magento Admin. Some of the more commonly used commands during development are listd below:

##### `cache:disable`
Disables specific caches. You might use this to disable the `layout`, `block_html`, and `full_page` caches during the development of some frontend templates so Magento always generates the pages you are working on rather than older versions that it has cached. Example:
```
bin/magento cache:disable layout block_html full_page
```

##### `cache:flush`
Destroys the Magento caches, deleting the cache keys. This can be used to destroy any of the Magento caches in combination. Example:
```
# destroy all caches
bin/magento cache:flush

# destroy configuration cache
bin/magento cache:flush config
```

##### `cache:status`
Lists the caches and whether they are enabled or disabled. You might use this prior to using the `cache:disable` or `cache:enable` commands.

##### `deploy:mode:set`
Sets your deploy mode. During development you will likely want to set this to `developer` whilst on your live server you will want to set this to `production`. Example:
```
# developer mode
bin/magento deploy:mode:set developer

# production mode
bin/magento deploy:mode:set production

# default mode
bin/magento deploy:mode:set default
```

##### `dev:query-log:enable`
Enables database query logging.

##### `indexer:reindex`
Runs the Magento indexers.

##### `module:disable`
Disables a specified module. Example:
```
bin/magento module:disable Module_Name
```

##### `module:enable`
Enables a specified module. Example:
```
bin/magento module:enable Module_Name
```

##### `module:status`
List all modules and whether they are enabled or disabled.

##### `setup:db:status`
Checks whether the Magento database needs to be upgraded.

##### `setup:upgrade`
Synchronises module versions in the database with those defined in the codebase.

#### 2.1. Describe Magento 2 Modes
> Understand the pros and cons of using developer mode or production mode.

##### Production
This mode should be used on your live production server. Production mode leads to an increase in performance by providing all necessary static files at the time of deployment rather than requiring Magento to dynamically locate and create static files during run time.

In this mode Magento:
- Logs exceptions and **does not** show exceptions on the frontend
- Serves static view files from the cache **only**
- Prevents automatic code compilation meaning that new or updated files are **not** written to the file system
- Prevents you from enabling or disabled cache types via Magento Admin

##### Developer
As it's name suggests, this mode is intended to be used during development only. When in this mode, Magento:
- Disables static view file caching instead writing them to `pub/static` every time they are called
- Provides verbose logging in `var/report`
- Enables automatic code compilation
- Displays uncaught exceptions to the frontend
- Enables enhanced debugging
- Shows custom `x-magento-*` HTTP request and response headers
- Performs slower

> How do you enable/disable maintenance mode?

Maintenance mode can be enabled and disabled via the command line:
```
# enable maintenance mode
bin/magento maintenance:enable

# disable maintenance mode
bin/magento maintenance:disable
```

---
#### 2.2. Demonstrate Ability To Use Frontend Controllers
> How do you identify which module/controller corresponds to a given URL?

`https://your-store.com/catalog/product/view/id/42`



---
> What would you do to create a given URL?

Set the Category and Product `url_key` attributes. You can also create URL rewrites through the Magento Admin path `Marketing > SEO & Search > URL Rewrites`

---
#### 2.3. URL Rewrites
URL rewrites provide a user-friendly URL to the customer in place of a cumbersome Magento URL. These values are stored in the `url_rewrite` table.

---
> How is the user-friendly URL of a product or category defined?

The product/category `url_key` attribute defines their URL. For each category a product belongs to, Magento will generate a URL based on the category tree before appending the product's `url_key`.

---
> How can you change a URL?

You can change a URL by creating a URL rewrite. The following actions also cause a URL to change:
- Updating a category's `url_key` attribute
- Updating a product's `url_key` attribute
- Modifying the categories a product belongs to

---
> How do you determine which page corresponds to a given user-friendly URL?

In the `url_rewrite` table you will find a row where the `request_path` value is the user-friendly URL. The corresponding `target_path` value is the internal Magento page. The `Magento_UrlRewrite` module contains a router that checks to see whether the given URL can be matched to a `request_path` in the `url_rewrite` table, redirecting to the `target_path` if a match is found.

---
### 3.0. Customising The Magento UI
This section covers **15%** of the exam.

#### 3.1. Customise The Magento UI Using Themes
> When would you create a new theme?

You would create a new theme when making design changes to the Magento frontend or admin. This typically involves copying and modifying layout files, templates, and styles to achieve your desired design.

---
> How do you define theme hierarchy for a project?

The `theme.xml` file can be used to specify the theme's parent using the `<parent />` node:
```XML
<theme xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Config/etc/theme.xsd">
    <title>Your Theme Name</title>
	<parent>Vendor/Theme</parent>
</theme>
```

Omitting the `<parent />` node dictates that the theme is the base, or default, theme.

---
#### 3.2. Blocks & Templates
> How do you assign a template to a block?

To assign a template to a block:
```XML
<block class="Namespace\Of\Your\Class"
       name="blockName"
       template="Module_Name::path/to/your/template.phtml"
/>
```

**NB:** The `path/to/your/template.phtml` starts from the `templates/` directory.

---
> How do you assign a different template to a native block?

To assign a template to an existing block, pass an argument to the block:
```XML
<referenceBlock name="blockName">
    <action method="setTemplate">
        <argument name="template" xsi:type="string">
            Module_Name::path/to/your/template.phtml
        <argument>
    </action>
</referenceBlock>
```

---
#### 3.3. Identify Different Types Of Blocks
> When would you use non-template block types?

| Block Type | Path | Use |
| :--------: | :--: | :-: |
| Text | `vendor/magento/framework/View/Element/Text.php` | Printing a string |
| ListText | `vendor/magento/framework/View/Element/Text/ListTest.php` | Output each of the child blocks |

---
#### 3.4. Magento Layout XML
> How do you use layout XML directives in your customizations?

Layout XML is what links templates to blocks and there are a number of directives available for use.

##### `<block />`
Defines a block. A block is a unit of page output that renders some distinctive content (anything visually tangible for the end-user), such as a piece of information or a user interface element. Blocks are a foundational building unit for layouts in Magento. They are the link between a PHP block class (which contains logic) and a template (which renders content). Blocks can have children and grandchildren (and so on).

| Attribute | Description | Values | Required |
| :-------: | :---------: | :----: | :------: |
| `class` | Name of a class that implements rendering of a particular block. An object of this class is responsible for actual rendering of block output. | Class name | No |
|` name` | Name that can be used to address the block to which this attribute is assigned. The name must be unique per generated page. If not specified, an automatic name will be assigned in the format `ANONYMOUS_n`. | 0-9, A-Z, a-z, underscore (`_`), period (`.`), dash (`-`). Should start with a letter. Case-sensitive. | No |
| `before` | Used to position the block before an element under the same parent. The element name or alias name is specified in the value. Use dash (`-`) to position the block before all other elements of its level of nesting. | Element name or dash (`-`). | No |
| `after` | Used to position the block after an element under the same parent. The element name or alias name is specified in the value. Use dash (`-`) to position the block after all other elements of its level of nesting. | Element name or dash (`-`). | No |
| `template` | A template that represents the functionality of the block to which this attribute is assigned. | Template file name | No |
| `as` | An alias name that serves as identifier in the scope of the parent element. | Same as `name` | No |
| `cachable` | Defines whether a block element is cacheable. This can be used for development purposes and to make needed elements of the page dynamic. | `true` or `false` | No |

```XML
@TODO: <block /> example
```

##### `<container />`
A structure without content that holds other layout elements such as blocks and containers.  A container renders child elements during view output generation. It can be empty or it can contain an arbitrary set of `<container>` and `<block>` elements. If the `<container>` is empty, and there is no child `<block>` available, it will not be displayed in the frontend source code.

| Attribute | Description | Values | Required |
| :-------: | :---------: | :----: | :------: |
|` name` | Name that can be used to address the block to which this attribute is assigned. The name must be unique per generated page. If not specified, an automatic name will be assigned in the format `ANONYMOUS_n`. | 0-9, A-Z, a-z, underscore (`_`), period (`.`), dash (`-`). Should start with a letter. Case-sensitive. | No |
| `label` | An arbitrary name to display in the web browser. | Any | No |
| `before` | Used to position the block before an element under the same parent. The element name or alias name is specified in the value. Use dash (`-`) to position the block before all other elements of its level of nesting. | Element name or dash (`-`). | No |
| `after` | Used to position the block after an element under the same parent. The element name or alias name is specified in the value. Use dash (`-`) to position the block after all other elements of its level of nesting. | Element name or dash (`-`). | No |
| `as` | An alias name that serves as identifier in the scope of the parent element. | Same as `name` | No |
| `output` | Defines whether to output the root element. If specified, the element will be added to output list. If not specified, the parent element is responsible for rendering its children. | Any value except the obsolete `toHtml`. Recommended value is `1`. | No |
| `htmlTag` | Output parameter. If specified, the output is wrapped into specified HTML tag. | Any valid HTML5 tag | No |
| `htmlID` | Output parameter. If specified, the value is added to the wrapper element. If there is no wrapper element, this attribute has no effect. | Any valid HTML5 `id` value | No |
| `htmlClass` | Output parameter. If specified, the value is added to the wrapper element. If there is no wrapper element, this attribute has no effect. | Any valid HTML5 `class` value | No |

```XML
@TODO: <container /> example
```

##### `<referenceBlock />` and `<referenceContainer />`
Updates in `<referenceBlock>` and `<referenceContainer>` are applied to the corresponding `<block>` or `<container>`. For example, if you make a reference by `<referenceBlock name="right">`, you are targeting the block `<block name="right">`.

| Attribute | Description | Values | Required |
| :-------: | :---------: | :----: | :------: |
| `remove` | Allows you to remove or cancel the removal of the element. When a container is removed, its child elements are removed as well. | `true` or `false` | No |
| `display` | Allows you to disable rendering of specific block or container with all its children (both set directly and by reference). The block‚Äôs/container‚Äôs and its children‚Äô respective PHP objects are still generated and available for manipulation. | `true` or `false` | No |

The `remove` attribute is optional and its default value is `false` This implementation allows you to remove a block or container in your layout by setting the remove attribute value to `true`, or to cancel the removal of a block or container by setting the value to `false`.
```XML
<referenceBlock name="blockName" remove="true" />
```

The `display` attribute is optional and its default value is `true`. You are always able to overwrite this value in your layout. In situation when the remove value is `true`, the `display` attribute is ignored.
```XML
<referenceContainer name="containerName" display="false" />
```

##### `<arguments />`
`<arguments>` is a required container for `<argument>`. It does not have its own attributes.
```XML
<arguments>
    ...
</arguments>
```

##### `<argument />`
Information can be passed from layout XML files to blocks using the `<argument />` node. These directives must always be enclosed within `<arguments />` directives. Argument values set in a layout file are added to the block's `data` array and can be accessed in templates using the `getData('argumentName')` and `hasData('argumentName')` functions. The latter returns a boolean defining whether there‚Äôs any value set.

| Attribute | Description | Values | Required |
| :-------: | :---------: | :----: | :------: |
| `name` | Argument name. | Must be unique. | Yes |
| `xsi:type` | Argument type. | 	`string` / `boolean` / `object` / `number` / `null` / `array` / `options` / `url` / `helper` | Yes |
| `translate` |  | `true` or `false` | No |

```XML
<arguments>
    <!-- String -->
    <argument name="stringArgName" xsi:type="string">
        Some String
    </argument>
    
    <!-- Boolean -->
    <argument name="booleanArgName" xsi:type="boolean">
        true
    </argument>
    
    <!-- Object -->
    <argument name="objectArgName" xsi:type="object">
        <!-- Must implement `Magento\Framework\View\Element\Block\ArgumentInterface` -->
        Namespace\To\Your\Class
    </argument>
    
    <!-- Number -->
    <argument name="numberArgName" xsi:type="number">
        42
    </argument>
    
    <!-- Null -->
    <argument name="nullArgName" xsi:type="null" />
    
    <!-- Array -->
    <argument name="arrayArgName" xsi:type="array">
        <item name="arrayKeyOne" xsi:type="string">First Item</item>
        <item name="arrayKeyTwo" xsi:type="object">Namespace\Of\Your\Class</item>
        ...
    </argument>
    
    <!-- Options -->
    <argument name="optionsArgName" xsi:type="options">
        <!-- Must implement `Magento\Framework\Data\OptionSourceInterface` -->
        Namespace\Of\Your\Class
    </argument>
    
    <!-- URL -->
    <argument name="urlArgName"
              xsi:type="url"
              path="your/url/path"
    />
    
    <!-- Helper -->
    <argument name="helperArgName" 
              xsi:type="string"
              helper="Namespace\To\Your\Helper\Class::helperFunction">
        <param name="paramName">paramValue</param>
    </argument>
<arguments>
```

**NB:** The `helper` can only use public functions.

##### `<move />`
Sets the declared block or container element as a child of another element in the specified order. 

| Attribute | Description | Values | Required |
| :-------: | :---------: | :----: | :------: |
| `element` | Name of the element to move. | Element name | Yes |
| `destination` | Name of the target parent element. | Element name | Yes |
| `as` | Alias name for the element in the new location. | 0-9, A-Z, a-z, underscore (`_`), period (`.`), dash (`-`). Case-sensitive.	 | No |
| `after` or `before` | Specifies the element‚Äôs position relative to siblings. Use dash (`-`) to position the block before or after all other siblings of its level of nesting. If the attribute is omitted, the element is placed after all siblings. | Element name | No |

```XML
<move element="elementName"
      destination="parentElementName"
      as="newAlias"
      after="siblingElementName"
      before="anotherSiblingElementName"
/>
```

**NB:**
- `<move>` is skipped if the element to be moved is not defined.
- If the `as` attribute is not defined, the current value of the element alias is used. If that is not possible, the value of the `name` attribute is used instead.
- During layout generation, the `<move>` instruction is processed before the removal (set using the `remove` attribute). This means if any elements are moved to the element scheduled for removal, they will be removed as well.

##### `<remove />`
`<remove>` is used only to remove the static resources linked in a page `<head>` section. For removing blocks or containers, use the `remove` attribute for `<referenceBlock>` and `<referenceContainer>`.
```XML
<!-- Remove local resources -->
<remove src="css/styles-m.css" />
<remove src="my-js.js"/>
<remove src="Magento_Catalog::js/compare.js" />

<!-- Remove external resources -->
<remove src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css"/>
<remove src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/js/bootstrap.min.js"/>
<remove src="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat" />
```

##### `<update />`
Includes a certain layout file.
```XML
<update handle="{handleNameToInclude}" />
```

### 4.0. Working With Databases In Magento
This section covers **18%** of the exam.

#### 4.1. Models, Resource Models, And Collections
> What are the responsibilities of each of the ORM object types?

The Magento ORM elements are:
- **Models:** Define entities, their data, and their behaviour.
- **Resource Models:** Data mappers for storage structures.
- **Collections:** Stores sets of Models and related functionality including filtering, sorting, and pagination.
- **Resources:** Maintain database connections through adapters.

---
> How do they relate to one another?

---
#### 4.2. Entity Loading And Saving
> How do you use the native Magento save/load process in the development process?

---
#### 4.3. Filter, Sort, And Select From Collections & Repositories
> How do you select a subset of records from the database?

##### Collections
**Filter:** `$collection->addFieldToFilter()`
**Sort:** `$collection->addOrder()`
**Select Column:** `$collection->addFieldToSelect()`
**Pagination:** `$collection->setPageSize()` and `$collection->setCurPage()`

##### Repositories
https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/extension-dev-guide/searching-with-repositories.html

---
#### 4.4. Declarative Schema
Declarative schema in Magento 2.3 allows developers to declare the final desired state of the database and has the system adjust to it automatically, without performing redundant operations. Developers are no longer forced to write scripts for each new version. Additionally, this approach allows data be deleted when a module is uninstalled - something that previously had to be done separately.

##### Terminology
Data Patch
- A class that contains data modification instructions. It can have dependencies on other data or schema patches.
- Some data patches can be reverted as a module or patch is uninstalled or deleted. Revertable operations are Data Query Language (DQL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`.

Schema Patch
- A class that contains custom schema modification instructions. Schema patches are used along with declarative schema, but these patches allow complex operations such as:
    - Adding triggers, stored procedures, or functions
    - Performing data migration with inside DDL operations
    - Renaming tables, columns, and other entities
    - Adding partitions and options to a table

---
> How do you add a column using declarative schema?

You can create/modify the `etc/db_schema.xml` file, specifying a `<table />` node for the table you are editing and adding a `<column />` node inside to create the new column.
```XML
<schema xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Setup/Declaration/Schema/etc/schema.xsd">
    <table name="table_name">
        <column xsi:type="varchar"
                name="title"
                padding="10"
                comment="Page Title"
        />
    </table>
</schema>
```

You can also create a schema patch file in the `YourCompany\YourModule\Setup\Patch\Schema` namespace:
```php
<?php
namespace YourCompany\YourModule\Setup\Patch\Schema;

use Magento\Framework\DB\Ddl\Table;
use Magento\Framework\Setup\Patch\SchemaPatchInterface;
use Magento\Framework\Setup\SchemaSetupInterface;

class YourSchemaPatch implements SchemaPatchInterface
{
    /** @var SchemaSetupInterface */
    private $moduleSchemaSetup;

    /**
     * YourSchemaPatch Constructor.
     *
     * @param SchemaSetupInterface $moduleSchemaSetup
     */
    public function __construct(SchemaSetupInterface $moduleSchemaSetup)
    {
        $this->moduleSchemaSetup = $moduleSchemaSetup;
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function apply()
    {
        $this->schemaSetup->startSetup();
        $table = $this->schemaSetup->getTable('your_table_name');
        $connection = $this->schemaSetup->getConnection();
        
        if ($connection->isTableExists($table)) {
            // declare new columns to add
            $newColumns = [
                'shiny_new_column' => [
                    'type' => Table::TYPE_TEXT,
                    'nullable' => true,
                    'comment' => 'Shiny New Column',
                ],
                'another_shiny_column' => [
                    'type' => Table::TYPE_TEXT,
                    'nullable' => true,
                    'comment' => 'OMG More Shinies! :O',
                ],
            ];

            foreach ($newColumns as $newColumn => $columnDescription) {
                $connection->addColumn($table, $newColumn, $columnDescription);
            }
        }

        $this->schemaSetup->endSetup();
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     */
    public static function getDependencies()
    {
        // return [dependencies]
    }
    
    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     */
    public function getAliases()
    {
        // return [aliases]
    }
}
```

**NB:** When adding new columns to a table, you also need to generate the `db_schema_whitelist.json` file.

---
> How do you modify a table added by another module?

To modify a table added by another module, create `Your_Company/Your_Module/etc/db_schema.xml` and specify the table name in the `<table />` node:
```XML
<schema xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Setup/Declaration/Schema/etc/schema.xsd">
    <table name="table_create_by_other_module">
        ...
    </table>
</schema>
```

---
> How do you delete a column?

To remove a column from a table created by your module you can simply remove the corresponding `<column />` node in `Your_Company/Your_Module/etc/db_schema.xml`. To drop a column declared in another module, you must redeclare it and set the `disabled` attribute to `true`:
```XML
<schema xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Setup/Declaration/Schema/etc/schema.xsd">
    <table name="table_create_by_other_module">
        ...
        <column xsi:type="int"
                name="new_id"
                padding="10"
                unsigned="true"
                nullable="false"
                comment="New ID"
                disabled="true"
        />
        ...
    </table>
</schema>
```

---
> How do you add an index or foreign key using declarative schema?

##### Index
To add an index, declare an `<index />` node in `Your_Company/Your_Module/etc/db_schema.xml`:
```XML
<schema xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Setup/Declaration/Schema/etc/schema.xsd">
    <table name="table_create_by_other_module">
        ...
        <index referenceId="INDEX_NAME" indexType="btree">
            <column name="column_name" />
        </index>
        ...
    </table>
</schema>
```

##### Foreign Key
To add a foreign key, declare a `<constraint />` node with an `xsi:type` of `foreign` in `Your_Company/Your_Module/etc/db_schema.xml`:
```XML
<schema xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Setup/Declaration/Schema/etc/schema.xsd">
    <table name="table_create_by_other_module">
        ...
        <constraint xsi:type="foreign"
                    referenceId="YOUR_REFERENCE_ID"
                    
                    <!-- The current table -->
                    table="table_name"
                    
                    <!-- The column in the current table that refers to a column in another table -->
                    column="column_name"
                    
                    <!-- The table being referenced -->
                    referenceTable=""
                    
                    <!-- The column being referenced -->
                    referenceColumn=""
                    
                    <!-- Foreign key trigger (CASCADE/SET/NULL/NO ACTION) -->

### 5.0. Developing With Adminhtml
This section covers **11%** of the exam.

#### 5.1. Admin Routes
> How would you create an admin controller?

---
> How do you ensure the right level of security for a new controller?

---
#### 5.2. System Configuration & Scopes
> How would you add a new system configuration option?

---
> What is the difference in this process for different option types (secret, file)?

---

```XML
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Magento_Backend:etc/menu.xsd">
   <menu>
       <add id="Your_Module::brief_module_description"
           title="Your Menu Tab Title"
           translate="title"
           module="Your_Module"
           sortOrder="10"
           
           <!-- No parent means the tab appears in the side bar -->
           parent="Magento_Catalog::inventory"
           
           <!-- No action means the item acts as a header -->
           action="path/to/your/controller"
           
           <!-- ID of the ACL entry that validates permissions -->
           resource="ACL_Entry_ID"
           />
   </menu>
</config>
```

---
> How do you add a new tab to the Admin menu?

Do not specify a `parent` attribute in the `<add />` node.

---
#### 5.5. Create User Permissions
> How are menu items related to ACL permissions?

Menu items are not shown to users with insufficient permissions to access them.

---
> How do you add a new user with given set of permissions?

Navigate to `System > Permissions > All Users` in Magento admin, add a new user, and set their role under `User Information > User Role`.

This can also be done programmatically:
```PHP
use Magento\User\Model\UserFactory;

// ...

protected $userFactory;

public function __construct(UserFactory $userFactory)
{
    $this->_userFactory = $userFactory;
}

public function execute()
{
    $user = $this->userFactory->create();
    $user->setData(
        [
            'username'          => 'user.name',
            'firstname'         => 'Forename',
            'lastname'          => 'Surname',
            'email'             => 'admin@test.com',
            'password'          => 'badpassword123',       
            'interface_locale'  => 'en_US',
            'is_active'         => 1
        ]
    );
    
    $user->setRoleId(1);
    $user->save(); 
}
```

### 6.0. Customising Magento Business Logic
This section covers **16%** of the exam.

#### 6.1. Product Types

| Product Type | Description |
| :----------: | :---------: |
| Simple | A simple product is a physical item with a single SKU. Simple products have a variety of pricing and of input controls which makes it possible to sell variations of the product. Simple products can be used in association with grouped, bundle, and configurable products. |
| Configurable | A configurable product appears to be a single product with lists of options for each variation. However, each option represents a separate, simple product with a distinct SKU, which makes it possible to track inventory for each variation.  |
| Grouped | A grouped product presents multiple, standalone products as a group. You can offer variations of a single product, or group them for a promotion. The products can be purchased separately, or as a group. |
| Bundle | A bundle product let customers ‚Äúbuild their own‚Äù from an assortment of options. The bundle could be a gift basket, computer, or anything else that can be customized. Each item in the bundle is a separate, standalone product. |
| Virtual | Virtual products are not tangible products, and are typically used for products such as services, memberships, warranties, and subscriptions. Virtual products can be used in association with grouped and bundle products. |
| Downloadable | A digitally downloadable product that consists of one or more files that are downloaded. The files can reside on your server or be provided as URLs to any other server. |
| Gift Card | There are three kinds of gift cards: virtual gift cards which are sent by email, physical gift cards which are shipped to the recipient, and combined gift cards which are a combination of the two. Each has a unique code, that is redeemed during checkout. Gift cards can also be included in a grouped product. |

---
> How would you obtain a product of a specific type? 

To obtain a specific product type, build search criteria and retrieve them from the product repository:
```PHP
use Magento\Catalog\Api\Data\ProductInterface;
use Magento\Bundle\Model\Product\Type;

...

public function getBundleProducts()
{
    $searchCriteria = $this->searchCriteriaBuilder
        ->addFilter(ProductInterface::TYPE_ID, Type::TYPE_CODE)
        ->create();
    
    return $this->productRepository->getList($searchCriteria)->getItems();
}
```

---
> What tools (in general) does a product type model provide?

The product type model is responsible for:
- Loading and configuring product options
- Preparing the product for the cart
- Processing product data to/from the database
- Checking whether the product can be sold
- Loading child products, when applicable

---
#### 6.2. Category Properties
> How do you create and manage categories?

---
#### 6.3. Product/Category Relations
> How do you assign and unassign products to categories?

Navigate to `Catalog > Inventory > Products` in Magento Admin, select the product you wish to add to a category, and use the `Categories` drop down selection options to assign it to categories.

---
#### 6.4. Product Behaviour In The Cart
> How are configurable and bundle products rendered?

`view/frontend/layout/checkout_cart_item_renderers.xml` define how products are rendered in the cart.

Configurable products are shown as a single line item. It is shown with the parent product's title and the simple product option selected by the customer.

Each product in the Bundle product is rendered as a single line item.

#### 6.6. Customer Account Area Customisation
> How would you add another tab in the ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù section?

To add an additional menu tab in the customer "My Account" area create the layout file in `Your_Company/Your_Module/view/frontend/layout/customer_account.xml`:
```XML
<body>
    <referenceContainer name="content">
        <referenceBlock name="customer_account_navigation">
            <block class="Magento\Customer\Block\Account\SortLinkInterface" 
                   name="yourBlockName"
                   after="customer-account-navigation-address-link">
                <arguments>
                    <argument name="label" xsi:type="string" translate="true">
                        Your Label
                    </argument>
                    <argument name="path" xsi:type="string">
                        path/to/your/module/view/
                    </argument>
                    <argument name="sortOrder" xsi:type="number">
                        10
                    </argument>
                </arguments>
            </block>
        </referenceBlock>
    </referenceContainer>
</body
```

---
> How do you customize the order history page?

To customise the "Order History" page create the layout file in `Your_Company/Your_Module/view/frontend/layout/sales_order_history.xml`. The `sales.order.history.info` container is a common location for modifications to be made.

---
#### 6.7. Add/Modify Customer Attributes
> How do you add or modify customer attributes in a setup script?

Create `Your_Company/Your_Module/Setup/UpgradeData.php` with an `upgrade()` function:
```PHP
use Magento\Customer\Model\Customer;

// ...

$attribute = $this->eavConfig->getAttribute(Customer::ENTITY, Attribute::CUSTOMER_PROMOTION_PREFERENCE);
$attribute->setData('used_in_forms', ['adminhtml_customer', 'customer_account_edit']);
$attribute->save();
```
